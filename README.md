# Facial recognition clock in application <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

## This is my repeat project for my college course module - project management - I will upload my project diary when the project is fully finished.

``` pip install opencv-contrib-python ```
##This application is designed to use opencv and training data to recognize employees of an organization via a digital camera and log when the computer recognizes them - this data is then used to predict when the employee came into work

<br>

1. Install python on your machine at https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-310/9PJPW5LDXLZ5 
2. Open command prompt and install opencv - contrib - ``` pip install opencv-contrib-python ```
3. Install pillow - ``` pip install pillow ```
